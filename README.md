Statement\nPrint Overview\nThis project outlines a modular Information and Inventory Management System (IIMS) built using Visual Basic and Access database architecture. It integrates user registration, biometric validation, workbook protection, supplier-product relationships, and project scheduling. The system is designed for educational institutions, technical training centers, and administrative bodies requiring secure, traceable, and bilingual documentation.\n?? Description\nThe system includes:\n" VB Forms (Kfrm1-Kfrm6): Registration, address capture, login, password recovery, biometric scan\n" Database Tables: Supplier, Category, Product, Order, Customer, Employee\n" Workbook Protection: Track changes, restrict editing, recall messages\n" Project Scheduling: Marketing research, vendor selection, scope definition\n" SmartArt Diagrams: Visual flow from research ? concept ? feedback ? release\n" Certificate Management: Score reporting, testing center integration, license validation\n?? Keywords\nVisual Basic, Access Database, ComboBox, CommandButton, Supplier Table, Product Inventory, Biometric Scanner, Workbook Protection, Certificate Path, SmartArt, Audit-Ready, Modular Forms, Curriculum Integration\n?? Data Analysis\nBinary Form Tracking\nEach form state is tracked using binary flags (0 = inactive, 1 = active/success). Example:\n" |1|0|1| | | S1|K1|10| ? Form 1 active, success flag = 1\n" |17|0|0| |S17|K17|170| ? Form 17 inactive, no success\nproject Metrics\nMetric Best Case Average Worst\nShipping Probability 98% 95% 90%\nBuildings 25,000 30,000 35\nCompetitive Products 7 8 9\nKey Success Probability 99% 95% 90%\nAQData\nDay A AQ Max\n365 93 150 237\n323 98 163 166\n365 168 152 182\n?? Information Management System\n" Inputs: User data, supplier info, product specs, project tasks\n" Processing: Form validation, biometric scan, credential encryption, workbook protection\n" Outputs: Confirmation messages, saved records, audit logs, score reports\n" Tools: VB combo boxes, command buttons, Access tables, SmartArt diagrams\n?? Methodology of Investigation\n" Design: Modular VB forms and Access tables\n" Development: Event-driven subroutines (cmd_Click, End Sub)\n" Testing: Simulated user flows, binary flag tracking, workbook protection scenarios\n" Validation: Error handling, recall message success/failure, certificate path selection\n??

Statement\nPrint Overview\nThis project outlines a modular Information and Inventory Management System (IIMS) built using Visual Basic and Access database architecture. It integrates user registration, biometric validation, workbook protection, supplier-product relationships, and project scheduling. The system is designed for educational institutions, technical training centers, and administrative bodies requiring secure, traceable, and bilingual documentation.\n?? Description\nThe system includes:\n\"   VB Forms (Kfrm1-Kfrm6): Registration, address capture, login, password recovery, biometric scan\n\"   Database Tables: Supplier, Category, Product, Order, Customer, Employee\n\"   Workbook Protection: Track changes, restrict editing, recall messages\n\"   Project Scheduling: Marketing research, vendor selection, scope definition\n\"   SmartArt Diagrams: Visual flow from research ? concept ? feedback ? release\n\"   Certificate Management: Score reporting, testing center integration, license validation\n?? Keywords\nVisual Basic, Access Database, ComboBox, CommandButton, Supplier Table, Product Inventory, Biometric Scanner, Workbook Protection, Certificate Path, SmartArt, Audit-Ready, Modular Forms, Curriculum Integration\n?? Data Analysis\nBinary Form Tracking\nEach form state is tracked using binary flags (0 = inactive, 1 = active/success). Example:\n\"   |1|0|1| | | S1|K1|10| ? Form 1 active, success flag = 1\n\"   |17|0|0| |S17|K17|170| ? Form 17 inactive, no success\nproject Metrics\nMetric  Best Case   Average Worst\nShipping Probability    98% 95% 90%\nBuildings   25,000  30,000  35\nCompetitive Products    7   8   9\nKey Success Probability 99% 95% 90%\nAQData\nDay A   AQ  Max\n365 93  150 237\n323 98  163 166\n365 168 152 182\n??

To scope Visual Basic (VBA) code, logigrammes, and algorigrammes around this setup, especially for credential tracking, audit assurance, or public service dashboards, we can align your modular logic with the following structure:\n?? Scoping Visual Basic Code, Logigrammes, and Algorigrammes\n1. ?? Contextual Mapping from Salesforce Objects\nUse the object list to define the data sources and event triggers for your VBA modules and diagrams:\nSalesforce Object   VBA Role    Logigramme Node Algorigramme Logic\nBooking__c  Source for guest activity tracking  \"Check Booking Status\"  If booking = confirmed ? proceed to session allocation\nExperience__c   Credential-linked activity  \"Validate Experience Type\"  If spa/golf ? apply reward logic\nSession__c  Time-slot logic \"Assign Session\"    Loop through available slots, match guest preference\nCredit__c   Reward logic    \"Apply Resort Credit\"   If guest rating ? threshold ? grant credit\nGuest_Review__c Feedback loop   \"Evaluate Review\"   If rating \u003c 3 ? flag for audit\nAuthorizationFormConsent    Compliance checkpoint   \"Check Consent Status\"  If missing ? halt credential issuance\n2. ?? VBA Module Scope\nDesign VBA modules to automate workflows across these objects:\n\"   Credential Export Sheet: Pulls Booking__c, Experience__c, and Session__c into a formatted dashboard.\n\"   Audit Tracker: Flags anomalies using Guest_Review__c, AuthorizationFormConsent, and CredentialStuffingEventStore.\n\"   Reward Allocator: Uses Credit__c logic to assign benefits based on guest engagement.\nExample VBA snippet for audit flagging:\nvb\nIf ReviewRating \u003c 3 Then\n    AuditSheet.Cells(i, \"Status\").Value = \"Flagged\"\n    Call NotifyComplianceTeam(GuestID)\nEnd If\n3. ?? Logigramme Design\nLogigrammes model workflow sequences. For example:\nCredential Issuance Flow\n\"   Start ? Check Booking ? Validate Experience ? Assign Session ? Check Consent ? Issue Credential ? End\nUse Shapes:\n\"   Rectangle: Action (e.g., \"Assign Session\")\n\"   Diamond: Decision (e.g., \"Consent Valid?\")\n\"   Arrows: Flow direction\n4. ?? Algorigramme Logic\nAlgorigrammes model decision logic and loops. For example:\nReward Allocation Algorithm\n\"   Input: Guest Rating, Booking Count\n\"   If Rating ? 4 and Bookings ? 3 ? Grant Credit\n\"   Else ? No reward\nUse:\n\"   Initialization block\n\"   Condition checks\n\"   Loops for session matching or anomaly scanning\nWould you like help drafting a bilingual VBA dashboard that integrates these logigrammes and algorigrammes for credential-linked workflows? I can scaffold the UserForm logic and export sheet structure next.\nThanks for sharing the Agentforce setup flow. Based on this, I'll help you scope a Visual Basic (VBA) dashboard, logigramme, and algorigramme that mirror the Agentforce logic for credential-linked automation, audit tracking, and public service dashboards - especially relevant to your modular credentialing and digital assurance work.\n?? Visual Basic Code Scope: Agentforce Credential Dashboard\n??

VBA Modules\nModule Name Function\nAgentSetupTracker   Logs agent creation steps, toggles, and deployment status\nCredentialExportSheet   Pulls booking and experience data into a formatted dashboard\nAuditLogManager Flags missing consent, poor reviews, or booking anomalies\nTopicActionMapper   Maps custom topics (e.g., Experience Management) to actions and logs\n?? Sample VBA Snippet: Consent Check\nvb\nIf ConsentStatus = \"Missing\" Then\n    MsgBox \"Consent not found. Credential issuance halted.\", vbExclamation\n    AuditSheet.Cells(i, \"Status\").Value = \"Consent Missing\"\nEnd If\n?? Logigramme: Agentforce Credential Workflow\n??

Logigramme: Logical Flow of CI Job\nA logigramme maps the logical decision flow. Here's how the CI job unfolds:\nplaintext\n[Start]\n   Print\n[Trigger: Push or PR to 'main']\n   Print\n[Job: build]\n   Print\n[Step: Checkout repo]\n   Print\n[Step: Run one-line script ? echo Hello, world!]\n   Print\n[Step: Run multi-line script ? echo build, test, deploy]\n   Print\n[Post-run: Checkout cleanup]\n   Print\n[Complete Job]\n   Print\nEnd\n?? 2. Algorigramme: Algorithmic Breakdown\nAn algorigramme focuses on the procedural logic. Here's a simplified version in pseudocode:\nvb\nSub CI_Workflow()\n    If PushToMain Or PullRequestToMain Then\n        Call BuildJob\n    End If\nEnd Sub\n\nSub BuildJob()\n    Call CheckoutRepo\n    Call RunOneLineScript\n    Call RunMultiLineScript\n    Call PostRunCleanup\nEnd Sub\n\nSub CheckoutRepo()\n    ' Uses actions/checkout@v4\nEnd Sub\n\nSub RunOneLineScript()\n    Debug.Print \"Hello, world!\"\nEnd Sub\n\nSub RunMultiLineScript()\n    Debug.Print \"Add other actions to build,\"\n    Debug.Print \"test, and deploy your project.\"\nEnd Sub\n\nSub PostRunCleanup()\n    ' GitHub Actions handles this automatically\nEnd Sub\n??? 3. Visual Basic Integration (for dashboard or audit sheet)\nIf you're embedding this logic into a UserForm or audit dashboard, you could use VBA like this:\nvb\nPrivate Sub btnRunCI_Click()\n    Dim jobStatus As String\n    jobStatus = \"CI Job Started\"\n\n    Call CheckoutRepo\n    Call RunOneLineScript\n    Call RunMultiLineScript\n\n    jobStatus = \"CI Job Completed\"\n    MsgBox jobStatus\nEnd Sub\nWould you like this mapped into a bilingual dashboard or exported into a credential-linked audit sheet? I can scaffold it for legacy preservation, registry assurance, or public service submission.\n0 s\nCurrent runner version: '2.329.0'\nRunner Image Provisioner\nOperating System\nRunner

Contextual Mapping from Salesforce Objects\nUse the object list to define the data sources and event triggers for your VBA modules and diagrams:\nSalesforce Object   VBA Role    Logigramme Node Algorigramme Logic\nBooking__c  Source for guest activity tracking  \"Check Booking Status\"  If booking = confirmed ? proceed to session allocation\nExperience__c   Credential-linked activity  \"Validate Experience Type\"  If spa/golf ? apply reward logic\nSession__c  Time-slot logic \"Assign Session\"    Loop through available slots, match guest preference\nCredit__c   Reward logic    \"Apply Resort Credit\"   If guest rating ? threshold ? grant credit\nGuest_Review__c Feedback loop   \"Evaluate Review\"   If rating \u003c 3 ? flag for audit\nAuthorizationFormConsent    Compliance checkpoint   \"Check Consent Status\"  If missing ? halt credential issuance\n2. ?? VBA Module Scope\nDesign VBA modules to automate workflows across these objects:\n\"   Credential Export Sheet: Pulls Booking__c, Experience__c, and Session__c into a formatted dashboard.\n\"   Audit Tracker: Flags anomalies using Guest_Review__c, AuthorizationFormConsent, and CredentialStuffingEventStore.\n\"   Reward Allocator: Uses Credit__c logic to assign benefits based on guest engagement.\nExample VBA snippet for audit flagging:\nvb\nIf ReviewRating \u003c 3 Then\n    AuditSheet.Cells(i, \"Status\").Value = \"Flagged\"\n    Call NotifyComplianceTeam(GuestID)\nEnd If\n3. ?? Logigramme Design\nLogigrammes model workflow sequences. For example:\nCredential Issuance Flow\n\"   Start ? Check Booking ? Validate Experience ? Assign Session ? Check Consent ? Issue Credential ? End\nUse Shapes:\n\"   Rectangle: Action (e.g., \"Assign Session\")\n\"   Diamond: Decision (e.g., \"Consent Valid?\")\n\"   Arrows: Flow direction\n4. ?? Algorigramme Logic\nAlgorigrammes model decision logic and loops. For example:\nReward Allocation Algorithm\n\"   Input: Guest Rating, Booking Count\n\"   If Rating ? 4 and Bookings ? 3 ? Grant Credit\n\"   Else ? No reward\nUse:\n\"   Initialization block\n\"   Condition checks\n\"   Loops for session matching or anomaly scanning\nWould you like help drafting a bilingual VBA dashboard that integrates these logigrammes and algorigrammes for credential-linked workflows?

Here's how the CI job unfolds:\nplaintext\n[Start]\n   Print\n[Trigger: Push or PR to 'main']\n   Print\n[Job: build]\n   Print\n[Step: Checkout repo]\n   Print\n[Step: Run one-line script ? echo Hello, world!]\n   Print\n[Step: Run multi-line script ? echo build, test, deploy]\n   Print\n[Post-run: Checkout cleanup]\n   Print\n[Complete Job]\n   Print\nEnd\n?? 2. Algorigramme: Algorithmic Breakdown\nAn algorigramme focuses on the procedural logic. Here's a simplified version in pseudocode:\nvb\n\n    If PushToMain Or PullRequestToMain Then\n        Call BuildJob\n    End If\nEnd Sub\n\n\n    Call CheckoutRepo\n    Call RunOneLineScript\n    Call RunMultiLineScript\n    Call PostRunCleanup\nEnd Sub\n\n\n    ' Uses actions/checkout@v4\nEnd Sub\n\n\n    Debug.Print \"Hello, world!\"\nEnd Sub\n\n\n    Debug.Print \"Add other actions to build,\"\n    Debug.Print \"test, and deploy your project.\"\nEnd Sub\n\n\n    ' GitHub Actions handles this automatically\nEnd Sub\n??? 3. Visual Basic Integration (for dashboard or audit sheet)\nIf you're embedding this logic into a UserForm or audit dashboard, you could use VBA like this:\nvb\n\n    Dim jobStatus As String\n    jobStatus = \"CI Job Started\"\n\n    Call CheckoutRepo\n    Call RunOneLineScript\n    Call RunMultiLineScript\n\n    jobStatus = \"CI Job Completed\"\n    MsgBox jobStatus\nEnd Sub\nWould you like this mapped into a bilingual dashboard or exported into a credential-linked audit sheet? I can scaffold it for legacy preservation, registry assurance, or public service submission.\n0 s\nCurrent runner version: '2.329.0'\nRunner Image Provisioner\nOperating System\nRunner

This is especially useful for your credential-linked dashboards, audit sheets, or public service workflows.\n?? Concept: Automating a CI Job in VBA\nLet's say you want to simulate a CI (Continuous Integration) job in VBA that:\n1.  Checks out a repository\n2.  Runs a one-line script\n3.  Runs a multi-line script\n4.  Logs post-run cleanup\n5.  Completes the job\n?? 1. Logigramme (Logic Diagram)\nThis shows the decision flow and sequence of operations:\nplaintext\n[Start]\n   Print\n[Trigger: Push or PR to 'main']\n   Print\n[Initialize Job]\n   Print\n[Checkout Repository]\n   Print\n[Run One-Line Script]\n   Print\n[Run Multi-Line Script]\n   Print\n[Post-Run Cleanup]\n   Print\n[Complete Job]\n   Print\nEnd\n?? 2. Algorigramme (Algorithm Diagram)\nThis shows the procedural logic in structured pseudocode or VBA logic blocks:\nvb\n\n    If TriggeredByPushOrPR() Then\n        Call CheckoutRepo\n        Call RunOneLineScript\n        Call RunMultiLineScript\n        Call PostRunCleanup\n        MsgBox \"CI Job Completed\"\n    Else\n        MsgBox \"No trigger detected.\"\n    End If\nEnd Sub\n\n\n    ' Simulate trigger condition\n    TriggeredByPushOrPR = True\nEnd Function\n\n\n    Debug.Print \"Repository checked out.\"\nEnd Sub\n\n\n    Debug.Print \"Hello, world!\"\nEnd Sub\n\n    Debug.Print \"Add other actions to build,\"\n    Debug.Print \"test, and deploy your project.\"\nEnd Sub\n\n    Debug.Print \"Post-run cleanup complete.\"\nEnd Sub\n?? Integration Tip for Audit Sheets\nYou can link this logic to a UserForm or dashboard button like this:\n\n    Call RunCIJob\nEnd Sub\nWould you like this exported into a bilingual credential-linked worksheet, or scaffolded into a printable logigramme/algorigramme diagram for registry assurance? I can also help modularize it for your legacy archive or public service submission.\n[Start: Candidate Application]\n   Print\n[Check Honest Representation]\n   Print\n[Is Information Accurate?]\n   ?

Logigramme: Logical Flow of CI Job\nA logigramme maps the logical decision flow. Here's how the CI job unfolds:\nplaintext\n[Start]\n   Print\n[Trigger: Push or PR to 'main']\n   Print\n[Job: build]\n   Print\n[Step: Checkout repo]\n   Print\n[Step: Run one-line script ? echo Hello, world!]\n   Print\n[Step: Run multi-line script ? echo build, test, deploy]\n   Print\n[Post-run: Checkout cleanup]\n   Print\n[Complete Job]\n   Print\nEnd\n?? 2. Algorigramme: Algorithmic Breakdown\nAn algorigramme focuses on the procedural logic. Here's a simplified version in pseudocode:\nvb\n\n    If PushToMain Or PullRequestToMain Then\n        Call BuildJob\n    End If\nEnd Sub\n\n    Call CheckoutRepo\n    Call RunOneLineScript\n    Call RunMultiLineScript\n    Call PostRunCleanup\nEnd Sub\n\n\n    ' Uses actions/checkout@v4\nEnd Sub\n\n    Debug.Print \"Hello, world!\"\nEnd Sub\n\n    Debug.Print \"Add other actions to build,\"\n    Debug.Print \"test, and deploy your project.\"\nEnd Sub\n\n    ' GitHub Actions handles this automatically\nEnd Sub\n??? 3. Visual Basic Integration (for dashboard or audit sheet)\nIf you're embedding this logic into a UserForm or audit dashboard, you could use VBA like this:\nvb\n\n    Dim jobStatus As String\n    jobStatus = \"CI Job Started\"\n\n    Call CheckoutRepo\n    Call RunOneLineScript\n    Call RunMultiLineScript\n\n    jobStatus = \"CI Job Completed\"\n    MsgBox jobStatus\nEnd Sub\nWould you like this mapped into a bilingual dashboard or exported into a credential-linked audit sheet? I can scaffold it for legacy preservation, registry assurance, or public service submission.\n0 s\nCurrent runner version: '2.329.0'\nRunner Image Provisioner\nOperating System\nRunner

To scope Visual Basic (VBA) code, logigrammes, and algorigrammes around this setup, especially for credential tracking, audit assurance, or public service dashboards, we can align your modular logic with the following structure:\n?? Scoping Visual Basic Code, Logigrammes, and Algorigrammes\n1. ?? Contextual Mapping from Salesforce Objects\nUse the object list to define the data sources and event triggers for your VBA modules and diagrams:\nSalesforce Object   VBA Role    Logigramme Node Algorigramme Logic\nBooking__c  Source for guest activity tracking  \"Check Booking Status\"  If booking = confirmed ? proceed to session allocation\nExperience__c   Credential-linked activity  \"Validate Experience Type\"  If spa/golf ? apply reward logic\nSession__c  Time-slot logic \"Assign Session\"    Loop through available slots, match guest preference\nCredit__c   Reward logic    \"Apply Resort Credit\"   If guest rating ? threshold ? grant credit\nGuest_Review__c Feedback loop   \"Evaluate Review\"   If rating \u003c 3 ? flag for audit\nAuthorizationFormConsent    Compliance checkpoint   \"Check Consent Status\"  If missing ? halt credential issuance\n2. ?? VBA Module Scope\nDesign VBA modules to automate workflows across these objects:\n\"   Credential Export Sheet: Pulls Booking__c, Experience__c, and Session__c into a formatted dashboard.\n\"   Audit Tracker: Flags anomalies using Guest_Review__c, AuthorizationFormConsent, and CredentialStuffingEventStore.\n\"   Reward Allocator: Uses Credit__c logic to assign benefits based on guest engagement.\nExample VBA snippet for audit flagging:\nvb\nIf ReviewRating \u003c 3 Then\n    AuditSheet.Cells(i, \"Status\").Value = \"Flagged\"\n    Call NotifyComplianceTeam(GuestID)\nEnd If\n3. ?? Logigramme Design\nLogigrammes model workflow sequences. For example:\nCredential Issuance Flow\n\"   Start ? Check Booking ? Validate Experience ? Assign Session ? Check Consent ? Issue Credential ? End\nUse Shapes:\n\"   Rectangle: Action (e.g., \"Assign Session\")\n\"   Diamond: Decision (e.g., \"Consent Valid?\")\n\"   Arrows: Flow direction\n4. ?? Algorigramme Logic\nAlgorigrammes model decision logic and loops. For example:\nReward Allocation Algorithm\n\"   Input: Guest Rating, Booking Count\n\"   If Rating ? 4 and Bookings ? 3 ? Grant Credit\n\"   Else ? No reward\nUse:\n\"   Initialization block\n\"   Condition checks\n\"   Loops for session matching or anomaly scanning\nWould you like help drafting a bilingual VBA dashboard that integrates these logigrammes and algorigrammes for credential-linked workflows? I can scaffold the UserForm logic and export sheet structure next.\nThanks for sharing the Agentforce setup flow. Based on this, I'll help you scope a Visual Basic (VBA) dashboard, logigramme, and algorigramme that mirror the Agentforce logic for credential-linked automation, audit tracking, and public service dashboards - especially relevant to your modular credentialing and digital assurance work.\n?? Visual Basic Code Scope: Agentforce Credential Dashboard\n??

VBA Modules\nModule Name Function\nAgentSetupTracker   Logs agent creation steps, toggles, and deployment status\nCredentialExportSheet   Pulls booking and experience data into a formatted dashboard\nAuditLogManager Flags missing consent, poor reviews, or booking anomalies\nTopicActionMapper   Maps custom topics (e.g., Experience Management) to actions and logs\n?? Sample VBA Snippet: Consent Check\nvb\nIf ConsentStatus = \"Missing\" Then\n    MsgBox \"Consent not found. Credential issuance halted.\", vbExclamation\n    AuditSheet.Cells(i, \"Status\").Value = \"Consent Missing\"\nEnd If\n?? Logigramme: Agentforce Credential Workflow\n??

Logigramme: Logical Flow of CI Job\nA logigramme maps the logical decision flow. Here's how the CI job unfolds:\nplaintext\n[Start]\n   Print\n[Trigger: Push or PR to 'main']\n   Print\n[Job: build]\n   Print\n[Step: Checkout repo]\n   Print\n[Step: Run one-line script ? echo Hello, world!]\n   Print\n[Step: Run multi-line script ? echo build, test, deploy]\n   Print\n[Post-run: Checkout cleanup]\n   Print\n[Complete Job]\n   Print\nEnd\n?? 2. Algorigramme: Algorithmic Breakdown\nAn algorigramme focuses on the procedural logic. Here's a simplified version in pseudocode:\nvb\nSub CI_Workflow()\n    If PushToMain Or PullRequestToMain Then\n        Call BuildJob\n    End If\nEnd Sub\n\nSub BuildJob()\n    Call CheckoutRepo\n    Call RunOneLineScript\n    Call RunMultiLineScript\n    Call PostRunCleanup\nEnd Sub\n\nSub CheckoutRepo()\n    ' Uses actions/checkout@v4\nEnd Sub\n\nSub RunOneLineScript()\n    Debug.Print \"Hello, world!\"\nEnd Sub\n\nSub RunMultiLineScript()\n    Debug.Print \"Add other actions to build,\"\n    Debug.Print \"test, and deploy your project.\"\nEnd Sub\n\nSub PostRunCleanup()\n    ' GitHub Actions handles this automatically\nEnd Sub\n??? 3. Visual Basic Integration (for dashboard or audit sheet)\nIf you're embedding this logic into a UserForm or audit dashboard, you could use VBA like this:\nvb\nPrivate Sub btnRunCI_Click()\n    Dim jobStatus As String\n    jobStatus = \"CI Job Started\"\n\n    Call CheckoutRepo\n    Call RunOneLineScript\n    Call RunMultiLineScript\n\n    jobStatus = \"CI Job Completed\"\n    MsgBox jobStatus\nEnd Sub\nWould you like this mapped into a bilingual dashboard or exported into a credential-linked audit sheet? I can scaffold it for legacy preservation, registry assurance, or public service submission.\n0 s\nCurrent runner version: '2.329.0'\nRunner Image Provisioner\nOperating System\nRunner

Contextual Mapping from Salesforce Objects\nUse the object list to define the data sources and event triggers for your VBA modules and diagrams:\nSalesforce Object   VBA Role    Logigramme Node Algorigramme Logic\nBooking__c  Source for guest activity tracking  \"Check Booking Status\"  If booking = confirmed ? proceed to session allocation\nExperience__c   Credential-linked activity  \"Validate Experience Type\"  If spa/golf ? apply reward logic\nSession__c  Time-slot logic \"Assign Session\"    Loop through available slots, match guest preference\nCredit__c   Reward logic    \"Apply Resort Credit\"   If guest rating ? threshold ? grant credit\nGuest_Review__c Feedback loop   \"Evaluate Review\"   If rating \u003c 3 ? flag for audit\nAuthorizationFormConsent    Compliance checkpoint   \"Check Consent Status\"  If missing ? halt credential issuance\n2. ?? VBA Module Scope\nDesign VBA modules to automate workflows across these objects:\n\"   Credential Export Sheet: Pulls Booking__c, Experience__c, and Session__c into a formatted dashboard.\n\"   Audit Tracker: Flags anomalies using Guest_Review__c, AuthorizationFormConsent, and CredentialStuffingEventStore.\n\"   Reward Allocator: Uses Credit__c logic to assign benefits based on guest engagement.\nExample VBA snippet for audit flagging:\nvb\nIf ReviewRating \u003c 3 Then\n    AuditSheet.Cells(i, \"Status\").Value = \"Flagged\"\n    Call NotifyComplianceTeam(GuestID)\nEnd If\n3. ?? Logigramme Design\nLogigrammes model workflow sequences. For example:\nCredential Issuance Flow\n\"   Start ? Check Booking ? Validate Experience ? Assign Session ? Check Consent ? Issue Credential ? End\nUse Shapes:\n\"   Rectangle: Action (e.g., \"Assign Session\")\n\"   Diamond: Decision (e.g., \"Consent Valid?\")\n\"   Arrows: Flow direction\n4. ?? Algorigramme Logic\nAlgorigrammes model decision logic and loops. For example:\nReward Allocation Algorithm\n\"   Input: Guest Rating, Booking Count\n\"   If Rating ? 4 and Bookings ? 3 ? Grant Credit\n\"   Else ? No reward\nUse:\n\"   Initialization block\n\"   Condition checks\n\"   Loops for session matching or anomaly scanning\nWould you like help drafting a bilingual VBA dashboard that integrates these logigrammes and algorigrammes for credential-linked workflows?

Here's how the CI job unfolds:\nplaintext\n[Start]\n   Print\n[Trigger: Push or PR to 'main']\n   Print\n[Job: build]\n   Print\n[Step: Checkout repo]\n   Print\n[Step: Run one-line script ? echo Hello, world!]\n   Print\n[Step: Run multi-line script ? echo build, test, deploy]\n   Print\n[Post-run: Checkout cleanup]\n   Print\n[Complete Job]\n   Print\nEnd\n?? 2. Algorigramme: Algorithmic Breakdown\nAn algorigramme focuses on the procedural logic. Here's a simplified version in pseudocode:\nvb\n\n    If PushToMain Or PullRequestToMain Then\n        Call BuildJob\n    End If\nEnd Sub\n\n\n    Call CheckoutRepo\n    Call RunOneLineScript\n    Call RunMultiLineScript\n    Call PostRunCleanup\nEnd Sub\n\n\n    ' Uses actions/checkout@v4\nEnd Sub\n\n\n    Debug.Print \"Hello, world!\"\nEnd Sub\n\n\n    Debug.Print \"Add other actions to build,\"\n    Debug.Print \"test, and deploy your project.\"\nEnd Sub\n\n\n    ' GitHub Actions handles this automatically\nEnd Sub\n??? 3. Visual Basic Integration (for dashboard or audit sheet)\nIf you're embedding this logic into a UserForm or audit dashboard, you could use VBA like this:\nvb\n\n    Dim jobStatus As String\n    jobStatus = \"CI Job Started\"\n\n    Call CheckoutRepo\n    Call RunOneLineScript\n    Call RunMultiLineScript\n\n    jobStatus = \"CI Job Completed\"\n    MsgBox jobStatus\nEnd Sub\nWould you like this mapped into a bilingual dashboard or exported into a credential-linked audit sheet? I can scaffold it for legacy preservation, registry assurance, or public service submission.\n0 s\nCurrent runner version: '2.329.0'\nRunner Image Provisioner\nOperating System\nRunner

This is especially useful for your credential-linked dashboards, audit sheets, or public service workflows.\n?? Concept: Automating a CI Job in VBA\nLet's say you want to simulate a CI (Continuous Integration) job in VBA that:\n1.  Checks out a repository\n2.  Runs a one-line script\n3.  Runs a multi-line script\n4.  Logs post-run cleanup\n5.  Completes the job\n?? 1. Logigramme (Logic Diagram)\nThis shows the decision flow and sequence of operations:\nplaintext\n[Start]\n   Print\n[Trigger: Push or PR to 'main']\n   Print\n[Initialize Job]\n   Print\n[Checkout Repository]\n   Print\n[Run One-Line Script]\n   Print\n[Run Multi-Line Script]\n   Print\n[Post-Run Cleanup]\n   Print\n[Complete Job]\n   Print\nEnd\n?? 2. Algorigramme (Algorithm Diagram)\nThis shows the procedural logic in structured pseudocode or VBA logic blocks:\nvb\n\n    If TriggeredByPushOrPR() Then\n        Call CheckoutRepo\n        Call RunOneLineScript\n        Call RunMultiLineScript\n        Call PostRunCleanup\n        MsgBox \"CI Job Completed\"\n    Else\n        MsgBox \"No trigger detected.\"\n    End If\nEnd Sub\n\n\n    ' Simulate trigger condition\n    TriggeredByPushOrPR = True\nEnd Function\n\n\n    Debug.Print \"Repository checked out.\"\nEnd Sub\n\n\n    Debug.Print \"Hello, world!\"\nEnd Sub\n\n    Debug.Print \"Add other actions to build,\"\n    Debug.Print \"test, and deploy your project.\"\nEnd Sub\n\n    Debug.Print \"Post-run cleanup complete.\"\nEnd Sub\n?? Integration Tip for Audit Sheets\nYou can link this logic to a UserForm or dashboard button like this:\n\n    Call RunCIJob\nEnd Sub\nWould you like this exported into a bilingual credential-linked worksheet, or scaffolded into a printable logigramme/algorigramme diagram for registry assurance? I can also help modularize it for your legacy archive or public service submission.\n[Start: Candidate Application]\n   Print\n[Check Honest Representation]\n   Print\n[Is Information Accurate?]\n   ?

Logigramme: Logical Flow of CI Job\nA logigramme maps the logical decision flow. Here's how the CI job unfolds:\nplaintext\n[Start]\n   Print\n[Trigger: Push or PR to 'main']\n   Print\n[Job: build]\n   Print\n[Step: Checkout repo]\n   Print\n[Step: Run one-line script ? echo Hello, world!]\n   Print\n[Step: Run multi-line script ? echo build, test, deploy]\n   Print\n[Post-run: Checkout cleanup]\n   Print\n[Complete Job]\n   Print\nEnd\n?? 2. Algorigramme: Algorithmic Breakdown\nAn algorigramme focuses on the procedural logic. Here's a simplified version in pseudocode:\nvb\n\n    If PushToMain Or PullRequestToMain Then\n        Call BuildJob\n    End If\nEnd Sub\n\n    Call CheckoutRepo\n    Call RunOneLineScript\n    Call RunMultiLineScript\n    Call PostRunCleanup\nEnd Sub\n\n\n    ' Uses actions/checkout@v4\nEnd Sub\n\n    Debug.Print \"Hello, world!\"\nEnd Sub\n\n    Debug.Print \"Add other actions to build,\"\n    Debug.Print \"test, and deploy your project.\"\nEnd Sub\n\n    ' GitHub Actions handles this automatically\nEnd Sub\n??? 3. Visual Basic Integration (for dashboard or audit sheet)\nIf you're embedding this logic into a UserForm or audit dashboard, you could use VBA like this:\nvb\n\n    Dim jobStatus As String\n    jobStatus = \"CI Job Started\"\n\n    Call CheckoutRepo\n    Call RunOneLineScript\n    Call RunMultiLineScript\n\n    jobStatus = \"CI Job Completed\"\n    MsgBox jobStatus\nEnd Sub\nWould you like this mapped into a bilingual dashboard or exported into a credential-linked audit sheet? I can scaffold it for legacy preservation, registry assurance, or public service submission.\n0 s\nCurrent runner version: '2.329.0'\nRunner Image Provisioner\nOperating System\nRunner

Highlighted is their advantages, limitations and some construction features you need to consider if developing that method of assessment.

                                                                                        More methods of assessment are covered within Assessment: A Guide for Centres offering Regulated Qualifications(opens in a new tab).

                                                                                        As you become more familiar with the various assessment methods you will begin to identify what is a natural fit for the assessment you are developing.

                                                                                            For example, in the vocational context some assessment methods will be an obvious choice and pair well with naturally occurring evidence from the workplace. Alternatively, you might find industry stipulations will dictate the assessment method, for example a First Aid at Work qualification requires learners to undertake a practical activity, such as performing CPR on a manikin.

Highlighted is their advantages, limitations and some construction features you need to consider if developing that method of assessment.

                                                                                        More methods of assessment are covered within Assessment: A Guide for Centres offering Regulated Qualifications(opens in a new tab).

                                                                                            For example, in the vocational context some assessment methods will be an obvious choice and pair well with naturally occurring evidence from the workplace. Alternatively, you might find industry stipulations will dictate the assessment method, for example a First Aid at Work qualification requires learners to undertake a practical activity, such as performing CPR on a manikin.

                                                                                        A portfolio is a means of presenting evidence of learner achievement.

                                                                                        It is a representative collection of different pieces of evidence of a learner’s skills, knowledge, understanding and competence which indicates that they have met the requirements of a qualification.

                                                                                        They can be produced in a range of media, and these days e-portfolios or cloud-based software are becoming the norm when compiling and storing portfolios.

                                                                                            •

                                                                                            Can be used to collect naturally-occurring evidence.

                                                                                            Allows the inclusion of photographic/electronic evidence.

                                                                                        A practical activity consists of any activity that allows learners to demonstrate their technical, artistic and creative skills.

                                                                                        The assessment may be based on the end-result of the activity (the product), or the carrying-out of the activity (the process), or a combination of both.

                                                                                        In the assessment of vocational qualifications this is commonly known as ‘Observation’ and is noted to be one of the most valid and reliable methods of assessment.

                                                                                        In some subjects, demonstrating a practical skill can show that learners can apply the knowledge needed to demonstrate competence. In other subjects, the underpinning knowledge may not be so clearly apparent. In such cases, an additional assessment such as questioning may be required to supplement any observation of the skill.

                                                                                            •

                                                                                            Assesses ‘real-life’ skills.

                                                                                            Practical activity can be very motivating for learners.

                                                                                        It allows learners to demonstrate their abilities and skills and so the process is normally the focus of the assessment, although the quality of the performance as a finished product may also be assessed. Again, this type of assessment method is commonly referred to as Observation in the vocational sector.

                                                                                        In some cases, the learner will also be required to analyse and reflect upon their performance, for example by providing a commentary or personal statement, and this product may also be assessed.

                                                                                            •

                                                                                            Can be used to confirm knowledge.

                                                                                            This assessment is wide-ranging and can cover outcomes from a number of units.

                                                                                        A professional discussion between a learner and an assessor focuses on evidence already provided or demonstrated by the learner.

                                                                                        This is likely to consist of real work activities, practical tasks, a case study, project, portfolio or some other form of assessment.

                                                                                        The assessor starts by asking the learner questions about the evidence, and a discussion ensues. The assessor must record the discussion. The assessor is responsible for ensuring that the points that need to be covered are brought into the discussion by the learner.

                                                                                        A professional discussion is not a substitute for the demonstration of skills. The learner needs to be able to show the assessor how what they say in the discussion is backed up in other ways.

                                                                                        This could be, for example, by product evidence, witness testimonies, workplace documents or other material either developed though work or in other assessments.

                                                                                            •

                                                                                            The professional discussion can be used to integrate assessment.

                                                                                            Be provided with guidance on how to develop your own MCQs.

                                                                                            Be provided with an overview of the SQA assessment development process.

                                                                                        Throughout the module there will be some reflection points to consolidate your knowledge and understanding these will prepare you for developing your own assessments.

                                                                                        MCQs are a tried and tested assessment method and are widely used across SQA’s many qualifications.  This module will focus on their use within our HN/VQ portfolio.

                                                                                        MCQ assessments can be easily administered within a digital or paper assessment. Currently, there are SQA developed MCQ assessments available on SOLAR and the SQA Secure Site across a variety of subject areas for example, Construction and Professional Taxi and Private Hire Driver at SCQF level 5.

                                                                                        MCQ assessments can be used to record a learner’s starting point, measure progress (formative assessment and feedback) and if used at the end of the unit (summative assessment) it can evidence their knowledge recall from their learning.

                                                                                                •

                                                                                            When developing an assessment, the following high-level process will be followed:

                                                                                            More detailed processes for developing a digital assessment or a paper-based assessment are available from the Digital Assessment Team and the Assessment Support Materials teams respectively.

                                                                                            To begin with you must familiarise yourself with the unit specification, its Learning Outcomes and Assessment Criteria. Some units may refer to these as Knowledge and Evidence Requirements, but they serve the same purpose.

                                                                                            When defining assessment content you must consider:
                                                                                                •

                                                                                                Is it demanding enough to provide adequate challenge?

                                                                                            1

                                                                                            If you are developing an assessment that covers multiple units, be sure that the content of the units is sufficiently related to make the assessment coherent and meaningful to learners.

                                                                                            You also need to consider the learner; vocational assessments must be set at a level that a minimally competent learner can achieve.

                                                                                            2

                                                                                            3

Rather it would be better to set a practical activity and ask the learner to demonstrate their abilities. This point relates to what naturally occurring evidence would be generated.

                                                                                            4

                                                                                            The below is outcome 1 of Unit - H83M 70 Contribute to Health and Safety when Conducting Archaeological Operation. The Unit specification clearly states the learning outcome and the assessment criteria stating the knowledge, understanding, skills and competencies to be assessed.

                                                                                            Furthermore, it stipulates the conditions of assessment and suggests assessment methods.  Unfortunately, not all unit specifications contain such direction and you may be required to use your professional judgement and expertise to determine this.

                                                                                            Assessment (evidence) requirements

                                                                                                Assessors must ensure that learners provide evidence to cover all the learning outcomes and assessment criteria.

                                                                                                This unit is designed to assess the skills of learners in the workplace. Evidence of occupational competence should be generated and collected through performance in workplace conditions. This includes the knowledge-based learning outcomes and assessment criteria of the competence units.

                                                                                                These conditions would be those typical to the learner’s normal place of work. The evidence collected under these conditions should also be as naturally occurring as possible. It is accepted that not all employees have identical workplace conditions and therefore there cannot be assessment conditions that are identical for all learners. However, assessors must ensure that, as far as possible, the conditions for assessment should be those under which the learner usually works.

                                                                                                Collection of evidence of performance can be used to substantiate, support and expand the evidence base for competent performance. This may include:

                                                                                                    Observation

It identifies the standards to which the learner has to perform and provides guidance on teaching and learning approaches. 

                                                                                            The graded unit specification will include:

Each ASP contains details of the assessment tasks which will correspond to the requirements set down within the graded unit specification. Your SQA Coordinator can access the secure website and obtain an ASP for you.  It is essential that all ASPs are kept secure.

                                                                                            When using an ASP from SQA’s website, it is still the centre’s responsibility to make sure that all the appropriate internal quality assurance procedures are satisfactorily completed. The centre must check that the assessment(s) (and marking guidelines) are valid, reliable, practicable, equitable and fair.

                                                                                            Coaching – moving from just telling to asking and guiding the other person towards their own answer – is a core skill for any senior appointee as well as an important KPM to achieve. 

                                                                                            It doesn’t have to take a great deal of time – it can actually be done in a few minutes by asking the appointee questions to help them think through the issue. 

                                                                                            Look for opportunities to use coaching questions with your team and try to move towards asking, not telling!
